   - ✅ Different icons for different notification types
   - ✅ Visual distinction for unread notifications (blue background)
   - ✅ Desktop and mobile responsive design
   - ✅ Testing component for developers

## 🔧 How to Test

### 1. **Using the NotificationTester**
   1. Go to **Settings** page
   2. Click on **Notifications** tab
   3. Scroll down to find **"Notification Tester"** section
   4. Click any button to create a test notification
   5. Check the notification bell in the header to see it appear

### 2. **Through User Actions**
   - **Log a meal**: Navigate to Log Meal page and submit a meal
   - **Upgrade to premium**: Complete the payment process (creates notification)

### 3. **Manual Testing via Console**
   1. Open browser console (F12)
   2. Make sure you're logged in
   3. Run this code:
   ```javascript
   // Import the service first (in your code)
   import { createNotification } from './services/notificationService';
   
   // Then create a notification
   const user = auth.currentUser;
   await createNotification({
     userId: user.uid,
     title: 'Test Notification',
     message: 'This is a test',
     type: 'info'
   });
   ```

## 📋 Firebase Setup Required

### Firestore Security Rules
You need to add these rules to your Firestore (Firebase Console → Firestore Database → Rules):

```javascript
match /notifications/{notificationId} {
  // Users can only read their own notifications
  allow read: if request.auth != null && resource.data.userId == request.auth.uid;
  
  // Users can create their own notifications
  allow create: if request.auth != null && request.resource.data.userId == request.auth.uid;
  
  // Users can update (mark as read) and delete their own notifications
  allow update, delete: if request.auth != null && resource.data.userId == request.auth.uid;
}
```

### Firestore Collection Structure
The system will automatically create a `notifications` collection with this structure:
```
notifications/
  └── {notificationId}
      ├── userId: string
      ├── title: string
      ├── message: string
      ├── type: string
      ├── read: boolean
      ├── createdAt: Timestamp
```

## 🎯 Next Steps

### To Commit Your Changes:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Implement real-time notification system with Firebase"
git push origin samuditha
```

### Future Enhancements (Optional):
1. **Push Notifications**: Add Firebase Cloud Messaging for browser push notifications
2. **Email Notifications**: Send important notifications via email
3. **Notification Preferences**: Let users choose which notifications they want
4. **Scheduled Notifications**: Schedule meal reminders for specific times
5. **Rich Notifications**: Add images and action buttons
6. **Notification Groups**: Group similar notifications together
7. **Notification History**: Keep an archive of old notifications
